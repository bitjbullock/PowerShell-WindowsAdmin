# PowerShell

A collection of scripts I've created over the years to administer things.

## Prerequisites

Some of the scripts require additional PowerShell modules to be installed and loaded, for example some of the Active Directory ones require the RSAT tools to be installed, and most of the VMware ones will require PowerCLI.

## State of the Scripts

Some of the scripts have comments in them to explain what is being done, some don't. Those which don't I am gradually working my way through to add them.
